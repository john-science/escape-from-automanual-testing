# Practicing with the `.filter(...)` method

# Remove the mark.xfail decorator,
# then improve the filter function to make the test pass.
@given(st.integers().filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0))
def test_filter_even_numbers(x):
    # If we convert any even integer to a string, the last digit will be even.
    assert str(x)[-1] in "02468"


@given(st.integers().filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 1))
def test_filter_odd_numbers(x):
    # If we convert any odd integer to a string, the last digit will be odd.
    assert str(x)[-1] in "13579"


# Takeaway
# --------
# While `.filter` was used here to the same effect as `.map` below,
# it should be noted that filtering should not be relied on to reject
# large populations of generated values. Hypothesis will raise if
# a strategy ends up filtering too many values in attempt to generate
# permissible ones.
#
# Suppose you want to generate all integers except 0, this is a perfect
# application of `.filter`:
#    `st.integers().filter(lambda x: x != 0)`


##############################################################################
# Practicing with the `.map(...)` method
# Same tasks as above, without using .filter(...).
# You'll need to change the value of the integer, then convert it to a string.


@given(st.integers().map(lambda x: x * 2))
def test_map_even_numbers(x):
    # Check that last character of string x is a substring of "02468"
    assert str(x)[-1] in "02468"


@given(st.integers().map(lambda x: x * 2 + 1))
def test_map_odd_numbers(x):
    assert str(x)[-1] in "13579"


# Takeaway
# --------
# `.map` permits us to extend Hypothesis' core strategies in powerful
# ways. See that it can be used to affect the individual values being
# produced by a strategy (e.g. mapping integers to even-valued
# integers), as well as to cast the values to a different type (e.g.
# mapping an integer to a string.
#
# If it seems like a data-type is missing from Hypothesis'
# strategies, then it is likely that a simple application of `.map`
# will suffice. E.g. suppose you want a strategy that generate deques,
# then
#     `deque_strat = st.lists(...).map(deque)`
# will serve nicely - we don't even need a lambda!


##############################################################################
# Defining recursive data.

# There are a couple of ways to define recursive data with Hypothesis,
# leaning on the fact that strategies are lazily instantiated.
#
# `st.recursive` takes a base strategy, and a function that takes a strategy
# and returns an extended strategy.  All good if we want that structure!
# If you want mutual recursion though, or have a complicated kind of data
# (or just limited time in a tutorial), `st.deferred` is the way to go.
#
# The `Record` exercise in pbt-101.py defined JSON using `st.recursive`,
# if you want to compare them, and has some extension problems that you
# could write as tests here instead.


# JSON values are defined as one of null, false, true, a finite number,
# a string, an array of json values, or a dict of string to json values.
json_strat = st.deferred(
    lambda: st.one_of(
        st.none(),
        st.booleans(),
        st.integers(),
        st.floats(),
        # TODO: Write out the rest of this definition in Hypothesis strategies!
    )
)
# If in doubt, you can copy-paste the definition of json_strat to an interactive
# prompt, and use the `.example()` method of the strategy to see what kind of
# data it generates.  Be warned though!  The distribution of `.example()`s is
# skewed towards simple options, and it should only ever be used interactively.


# You can use `@settings(verbosity=hypothesis.Verbosity.verbose)` (or `debug`,
# or `pytest -s --hypothesis-verbosity=verbose`) to see what's going on,
# or get a summary with the `hypothesis.event(message)` function and
# `pytest --hypothesis-show-statistics ...`
@given(json_strat)
def test_json_dumps(value):
    """Checks that value is serialisable as JSON."""
    # We expect this test to always pass - the point of this exercise is
    # to define a recursive strategy, and then investigate the values it
    # generates for a *passing* test.
    hypothesis.note("type: {}".format(type(value)))
    hypothesis.event("type: {}".format(type(value)))
    json.dumps(value)


# Takeaway: you've seen and played with a few ways to see what a
# passing test is doing, without having to inject a failure.


##############################################################################
# `@st.composite` exercise

# This goal of this exercise is to play with a contrived data dependency,
# using a composite strategy to generate inputs.  You can use the same tricks
# as above to check what's being generated, so try to keep the test passing!


@st.composite
def a_composite_strategy(draw):
    """Generates a (List[int], index) pair.  The index points to a random positive
    element (>= 1); if there are no positive elements index is None.

    `draw` is used within a composite strategy as, e.g.::

        >>> draw(st.booleans()) # can draw True or False
        True

    Note that `draw` is a reserved parameter that will be used by the
    `st.composite` decorator to interactively draw values from the
    strategies that you invoke within this function. That is, you need
    not pass a value to `draw` when calling this strategy::

       >>> a_composite_strategy().example()
       ([-1, -2, -3, 4], 3)
    """
    lst = draw(st.lists(st.integers(min_value=1), min_size=1, max_size=100))
    index = draw(st.integers(0, len(lst) - 1))
    return (lst, index)


@given(a_composite_strategy())
def test_a_composite_strategy(value):
    lst, index = value
    assert all(isinstance(n, int) for n in lst)
    if index is None:
        assert all(n < 1 for n in lst)
    else:
        assert lst[index] >= 1


# Takeaway
# --------
# Why generate a tuple with a `@composite` strategy instead of using two
# separate strategies?  This way we can ensure certain relationships between
# the `lst` and `index` values!  (You can get a similar effect with st.data(),
# but the reporting and reproducibility isn't as nice.)
